## Workshop:
**The 10th International Workshop on Big Data Management and Service**


## Abstract:

The proliferation of new technologies such as Internet of things, social networks and cloud computing produces datasets whose volume, velocity, and variability are beyond the ability of commonly used software tools. Efficient processing of big data creates notable research challenges and opportunities for traditional databases and infrastructure. On the other hand, computing and software are turned into commodity services by cloud computing, so it is necessary to examine Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) from both technology and business aspects.

This workshop welcomes different kinds of papers that emphasize theoretical foundations, algorithms, systems, and applications for big data management and service. Submitted papers may address issues including big data theory, architecture, modeling, analytics, mining, business, toolkits, visualization, open platforms, applications. Papers of applied research, industrial experience reports, work-in-progress, and vision papers with different criteria for each category are also solicited.

**Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to:**

* Challenges and Open Problems for Big Data Management and Service (Vision Paper)
* Big Data Theory, Modeling and Representation
* Big Data Platforms, Systems, and Architecture
* Big Data Mining and Analytics
* Distributed and Parallelized Algorithms for Big Data
* Real-time and Streaming Algorithms for Big Data
* Big Data Toolkits and Visualization
* Big Data Applications (Internet of Things, Social Networks, etc.)
* Security, Trust, and Privacy Issues in Big Data Sharing
* Delivery, Deployment, and Maintenance of Big Data as a Service (BDaaS)
* Vector Database
* Foundation Models

* **Speaker**: Chengliang Chai (Associate professor, Beijing Institute of Technology, China)
  
* **Biography**: Chengliang Chai is currently an associate professor in Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China. He received the PH.D. de gree in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University. His research interests include crowdsourcing data manage ment, data mining and database. He has publised more than 50 papers from top-tier conference like SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, etc. He won the CCF doctoral  dissertation award and ACM China doctoral  dissertation award.
* **Abstract**: Given a dataset with incomplete data (e.g., missing values), training a machine learning model over the incomplete data requires two steps. First, it requires a data-effective step that cleans the data in order to improve the data quality (and the model quality on the cleaned data). Second, it requires a data-efficient step that selects a core subset of the data (called coreset) such that the trained models on the entire data and the coreset have similar model quality, in order to improve the training efficiency. The first-data-effective-then-data-efficient methods are too costly, because they are expensive to clean the whole data; while the first-data-efficient-then-data-effective methods have low model quality, because they cannot select high-quality coreset for incomplete data. We investigate the problem of coreset selection over incomplete data for data-effective and data-efficient machine learning. The essential challenge is how to model the incomplete data for selecting high-quality coreset. To this end, we propose the GoodCore framework towards selecting a good coreset over incomplete data with low cost. To model the unknown complete data, we utilize the combinations of possible repairs as possible worlds of the incomplete data. Based on possible worlds, GoodCore selects an expected optimal coreset through gradient approximation without training ML models. We formally define the expected optimal coreset selection problem, prove its NP-hardness, and propose a greedy algorithm with an approximation ratio. To make GoodCore more efficient, we further propose optimization methods that incorporate human-in-the-loop imputation or automatic imputation method into our framework. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework with low cost.
